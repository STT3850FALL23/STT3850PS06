# Background

We will again use the hate crimes data we used in Problem Set 05. The FiveThirtyEight article  about those data are in the Jan 23, 2017 ["Higher Rates Of Hate Crimes Are Tied To Income Inequality."](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/higher-rates-of-hate-crimes-are-tied-to-income-inequality/) This week, we will use these data  to run regression models with a single categorical predictor (explanatory) variable **and** a single numeric predictor (explanatory) variable. 

## Setup

First load the necessary packages: 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(moderndive)
library(readr)
```

The following code uses the function `read_csv()` to read in the data and store the information in an object named `hate_crimes`.

```{r}
url <- "http://bit.ly/2ItxYg3"
if(!dir.exists("./data/"))
{dir.create("./data/")}
if(!file.exists("./data/hate_crimes.csv")){
    download.file(url, destfile = "./data/hate_crimes.csv")}
hate_crimes <- read_csv("./data/hate_crimes.csv")
```

Next, let's explore the `hate_crimes` data set using the `glimpse()` function from the `dplyr` package:

```{r}
glimpse(hate_crimes)
```

You should also examine the data in the **data viewer**.  


Each case/row in these data is a state in the US. This week we will consider the response variable `income`, which is the numeric variable of median income of households in each state. 

We will use

* A categorical explanatory variable `urbanization`: level of urbanization in a region
* A numerical explanatory variable `share_pop_hs`: the percentage of adults 25 and older with a high school degree 

______

## Income, Education and Urbanization 

We will start by modeling the relationship between:

* $y$: Median household income in 2016
* $x_1$: numerical variable percent of adults 25 and older with a high-school degree, contained in the `hs` variable  
* $x_2$: categorical variable level of urbanization in a state: `low`,  or `high`, as
contained in the variable `urbanization`

________

# Exploratory Data Analysis

We will start by creating a scatterplot showing: 

* Median household `income` on the $y$ axis
* Percent of adults 25 or older with a high school degree on the $x$ axis
* The points colored by the variable `urbanization`
* A line of best fit (regression line) for each level of the variable `urbanization` (one for "low", one for "high")


```{r, label = "urb", fig.cap = "Median household income versus percent of adults with high-school degree in states with differing levels of urbanization"}
ggplot(data = hate_crimes, aes(y = income, x = hs, color = urbanization)) +
  geom_point()+ 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
  labs(
    x = "Percent of adults with high-school degree", 
    y = "Median household income in USD $", 
    title = "Income versus education in states with differing levels of urbanization") + 
  theme_bw()
```

4. Based on the data visualization in Figure \@ref(fig:urb), and your answer to 3, do you think it would be best to run a "parallel slopes" model (i.e. a model that estimates one shared slope for the two levels of urbanization), or a more complex "interaction model" (i.e. a model that estimates a separate slope for the two levels of urbanization)?

6.  Run a linear regression model that examines the relationship between household `income` (as response variable), and high-school education, and `urbanization` as explanatory variables.  Store the results of your model in an object named `med_income_model`.  Generate the regression table using the `get_regression_table()` function from the `moderndive` package. Graph the model stored in `med_income_model`.

```{r}
library(scales)  # Used to format numbers and for dollars
# Type your code and comments inside the code chunk
med_income_model <- lm(income ~ hs + urbanization, data = hate_crimes)

# Independent Analysis 


```{r, label = "VOLE", echo = FALSE, out.width=600, fig.cap = "Vole in the wild"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://ptes.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/water-vole-credit-Iain-Green-www.wildwonder.co_.uk-2_cropped.jpg")

```

You will now use the tools you have learned, and a new data set to solve a conservation problem.  

Wildlife biologists are interested in managing/protecting habitats for a declining species of vole, but are not sure about what habitats it prefers. Two things that biologists can easily control with management is percent cover of vegetation, and where habitat improvements occur (i.e. is it important to create/protect habitat in moist or dry sites, etc). To help inform habitat management of this vole species, the researchers in this study counted the number of `voles` at 56 random study sites. At each site, they measured percent cover of  `veg`etation, and recorded whether a site had moist or dry `soil`. 

The data are read into the object `vole_trapping` using the `read_csv()` function below.

```{r}
url <- "http://bit.ly/2IgDF0E"
if(!dir.exists("./data/")){
  dir.create("./data/")
  }
if(!file.exists("./data/vole_trapping.csv")){
    download.file(url, destfile = "./data/vole_trapping.csv")
  }
vole_trapping <- read_csv("./data/vole_trapping.csv")
```

The data contains the variables: 

* `site` for the id of each random study site (each case or row is a survey/trapping site)
* `voles` for the vole count at each site
* `veg` for the percent cover of vegetation at each site
* `soil` identifying a site as "moist" or "dry"

_________

17.  Generate a regression model with `voles` as the response variable `y` and `veg` and `soil` as explanatory variables.  Store the model in an object  named `voles_mod`. Use the results of the model to answer the following questions **based on the available data**. Create a data visualization (parallel slopes) to help answer the questions.

19.  Dry sites are typically a lot less money to purchase and maintain for conservation organizations. Thus, if a conservation organization decides to purchase a few dry sites, roughly what percent cover of vegetation do they need to maintain on these sites (at a minimum) to support a population of about 30 voles at the site?
